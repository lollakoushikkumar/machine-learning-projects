## 📊 1. Iris Flower Classification

### 🔹 Objective
To classify iris flowers into three species:
- Setosa
- Versicolor
- Virginica

based on sepal and petal measurements.

### 🔹 Dataset
- Iris Dataset (scikit-learn / UCI Repository)

### 🔹 Algorithm Used
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

### 🔹 Key Steps
- Data loading and exploration
- Data visualization
- Train-test split
- Model training
- Evaluation using accuracy and confusion matrix

### 🔹 Result
The model achieves high accuracy due to clear feature separation between flower species.
